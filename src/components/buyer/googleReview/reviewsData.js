It seemed that the good deals were reserved for others, not me, When I went to Finance That online, I was treated the same as everyone else. I bought the Camry I wanted, slightly used, for a great price with payments lower than leasing I wanted and I am very thrilled. So much that I have trouble parking it for the night.”",
